# Game architecture
Game is usinng ECS pattern (pixi-ecs library). Blue squares are objects, yellow components.

![game architecture diagram](./docs/jackman_architecture.png)

## Global components
  - **Stage manager** - manages whole game. Initializations, loading levels, switching screens...

## MenuScreen components
  - **ScreenWelcome, ScreenLevelName, ScreenGameOver, ScreenWinGame** - shows initial/level name/game over/win game screen.

## Statusbar components
  - **StatusbarController** - holds information about different parts of statusbar - healthbar, coinbar etc.

    - **HealthbarController** - shows information about health in top right corner.

    - **CoinbarController** - shows information about collected coins in top left corner.

    - **ItembarController** - shows information about taken items in right bottom corner.

    - **AmmoController** - shows information about ammo in left bottom corner (only if player picked up gun).

## Maplayer (game) components
  - **InfoboxController** - prints the text of its infobox.

  - **PlayerController** - solves user input and basic physics engine - collision with walls, gravity, moving with player (NOT with powerups, monsters).

  - **PlayerCollision** - solves player collision with monsters/powerups/keys/infoboxes/exit door.

  - **PlayerStateUpdater** - takes care of health, coins, ammo, items, etc. It also sends messages to statusbars.

  - **Camera** - moves camera with player (owner).

  - **TextureChanger** - changes (flips) player or monster (owner) textures when they change direction.

  - **BlinkingSprite** - makes owner blinking, e.g. when monster hit player.

  - **PlayerKey** - is assigned to player, when he picks up key. It controlls, if the locked door can be open.

  - **PlayerGun** - is assgined to the player, when he takes a gun. It controls shooting (keyboard input, creating bullet) and also creates texture with gun on player. 

  - **MonsterController** - controlls movement of monster object.

  - **BulletController** - moves bullet left or right and checks for collision.
